# Disclaimer - 
My App "inDex" has been made very carefully also the notes/documents uploaded in the app as well as in the website are uploaded correctly all the times. Though me and my team are mostly humans so we are bound to make mistakes. There will be times when there will be bug or some issue arising in the app which will be fixed asap after it is reported. If you incurred any kind of loss or got into some problem due to non-availablity of notes, error in notes, bugs in app or with anything related to inDex app and its website, me and my team won't be held responsible in any sense. We made this app for helping students like us who struggle with finding study material on time. This app is free and we don't earn anything from this app so please support it. Few errors will come and go, keep giving your valuable feedback and support.
