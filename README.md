# inDex (B.Tech CSE)
Do you usually find yourself in a situation where you are trying to find notes/PDFs of a particular chapter and asking your friends for them but nothing is found? I guess I have developed a solution for it. From now on, you can use my app and website to accesss all the notes and other material. Everything is hosted on a cloud server and proper a backup is maintained. Server is capable enough for supplying small PDFs and videos to few hundred people at a time and it is backed by Google.


# How did I made this?
I dont know, to be honest I was just watching some YouTube Videos and got a idea to make something like this. I learnt very basic designing, used some online engines and the the good old AndroidStudio for the apk. For the website, everything is taken from GitHub and my Configs are applied on top of that.
